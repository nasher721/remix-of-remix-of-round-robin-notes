            Last reviewed: July 11, 2026. This overview describes application behavior, not a certification or compliance determination for a particular deployment.

          <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-foreground">Deployment responsibility</h2>
          <p>
            The deployment operator is responsible for validating hosting, authentication, authorization policies, administrative access, backups, monitoring, incident response, provider agreements, and device controls before sensitive data is used.
          </p>
          <p>
            Clinical content is stored in the configured backend and may be synchronized to authenticated clients. Authentication alone does not prove that authorization is correctly configured; each deployment must test its database and storage policies for its intended roles.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section className="space-y-3 leading-[1.5] text-muted-foreground">
          <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-foreground">Transport, hosting, and browser storage</h2>
          <p>
            When deployed behind HTTPS, traffic is encrypted in transit between the browser and configured services. This transport protection is not end-to-end encryption. At-rest encryption, backup encryption, key management, and data residency depend on the selected hosting and storage configuration and must be confirmed by the deployment operator.
          </p>
          <p>
            The application may cache clinical content in browser storage for application and offline features. Use managed-device controls and operating-system protections, restrict shared-device use, and sign out when a session is complete. Authentication and password handling depend on the configured identity provider.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section className="space-y-3 leading-[1.5] text-muted-foreground">
          <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-foreground">Change history and audit coverage</h2>
          <p>
            Some record fields preserve change timestamps and user attribution where the feature is enabled and an authenticated identity is available.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is not a comprehensive access audit log and should not be presented as one. The deployment operator must add, retain, protect, and review any audit logging required by its policies or applicable law.
